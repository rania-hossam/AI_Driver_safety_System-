# AI_Driver_safety_System-
uses computer vision and machine learning techniques to improve driver safety.

The project includes several modules, including head and body detection, lines detection using Hough transform, and stop sign detection, all of which can help alert the driver to potential hazards on the road. One of the most impressive modules is the posture_steeringwheel_lookingstraight, which can detect when the driver is not sitting in an optimal position and provide feedback to encourage better posture.

What's great about this project is that it's focused on a specific problem - improving seatbelt usage - and provides a range of tools to tackle that problem. It also uses the YOLOv8 object detection algorithm, which is known for its accuracy and speed.

As someone who's interested in using technology to make driving safer, I find this project to be an inspiring example of what's possible with computer vision and machine learning. If you're curious about how these technologies can be applied to driver safety, or want to get involved in an exciting open-source project
