# AI Driver Safety System ðŸš—ðŸ’¡

Welcome to the AI Driver Safety System, an open-source initiative harnessing the power of computer vision and machine learning to revolutionize road safety.

# Key Features
- #### Vigilant Monitoring:
  Utilizes machine learning for head and body detection to ensure driver attentiveness.
  
- #### Road Awareness:
  Implements Hough transform for precise line detection and robust stop sign recognition.

- ### Posture Correction:
  Features an advanced posture analysis module to encourage optimal driving posture.
- ### Seatbelt Adherence:
  A dedicated module focused on promoting seatbelt use with timely alerts.

- ### Proximity Sensing:
  Integrates ToF sensors to alert drivers about the proximity of objects , the sensors will be installed in multiple points in the car
  allowing them to almost sense for any object coming close to the car , and alerting the driver in various ways allowing him to do stuff like parking more effectively ,
  also using it's readings in various calculations enhancing the overall driving safty .
# Hardware Setup
- ### Raspberry Pi 4:
  The brain of our system, providing a powerful yet compact computing platform.
- ### VLX ToF Sensors: 
  Our eyes for distance measuring, ensuring a safer driving environment.
- ### Pi Camera:
  Captures real-time footage for our detection algorithms to analyze.
# Prototype Demonstration 
we made a simple 3d desgin for a sesnor head with 5 vlx sensors that measures and looks for obstacles from different angels, 
this prototype can be installed on a mini car showing how these sensors can work with the models , this can be enhanced even more later for more precise measurements of various other factors ,
here is how or 3d printed sensor head looks :
