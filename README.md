# AI Driver Safety System
Overview
The AI Driver Safety System is an innovative project that leverages advanced computer vision and machine learning techniques on the Raspberry Pi 4 platform to enhance road safety. This system now integrates with hardware, utilizing multiple VLX Time-of-Flight (ToF) sensors for spatial awareness, and a dedicated Raspberry Pi camera for real-time visual analysis.

Features
Multi-Point Distance Sensing: Employs ToF sensors to measure proximity to obstacles, alerting drivers to avoid collisions.
Enhanced Visual Detection: Utilizes a Raspberry Pi camera to implement head, body, and line detection modules, alongside stop sign recognition to alert drivers of road hazards.
Posture Monitoring: Features a posture_steeringwheel_lookingstraight module to ensure drivers maintain an optimal position, promoting attentive driving.
Updates
Hardware Implementation: Fully compatible with Raspberry Pi 4, enabling portable and efficient deployment in vehicles.
Real-Time Alerts: Immediate feedback system to warn against seatbelt neglect, and potential collision threats.
Contributions
Contributors are welcome to explore the restructured project, now with organized modules for facial features, body estimation, traffic signs, object tracking, posture analysis, and seatbelt usage. We value collaborative enhancement and invite developers to join this open-source initiative to make driving safer.
