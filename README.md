# AI Driver Safety System ðŸš—ðŸ’¡

Welcome to the AI Driver Safety System, an open-source initiative harnessing the power of computer vision and machine learning to revolutionize road safety.

# Key Features
- #### Vigilant Monitoring:
  Utilizes machine learning for head and body detection to ensure driver attentiveness.
  
- #### Road Awareness:
  Implements Hough transform for precise line detection and robust stop sign recognition.
- ### Posture Correction:
  Features an advanced posture analysis module to encourage optimal driving posture.
- ### Seatbelt Adherence:
  A dedicated module focused on promoting seatbelt use with timely alerts.
- ### Proximity Sensing:
  Integrates ToF sensors to alert drivers about the proximity of objects.
# Hardware Setup
- ### Raspberry Pi 4:
  The brain of our system, providing a powerful yet compact computing platform.
- ### VLX ToF Sensors: 
  Our eyes for distance measuring, ensuring a safer driving environment.
- ### Pi Camera:
  Captures real-time footage for our detection algorithms to analyze.
# Prototype Demonstration 
we made a simple 3d desgin for a sesnor head with 5 vlx sensors that measures and looks for obstacles from different angels here is how it looks :
